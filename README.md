# a few notes about this app 
I have used Tailwind for CSS styling and included a create_tables.sql file to recreate the db (and a drop_tables.sql file to remove the tables).
Please let me know if you cannot see my previous commits - in either case, they should be visible in my personal repo:

https://github.com/thauling/onepage_crud.git

# Tailwind instructions:
execute 'npm run build-css' to rebuild css file, then refresh browser. 'build-css' is specified inside 'package.json' under "scripts"
